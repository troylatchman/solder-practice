This repo wil probably not contain any code.
It is just a place for me to save what I have done on the hardware side of things.
Despite being in the computer field, I did not know how to solder until recently.
I decided to get some modest gear (iron, wick, etc) and a "practice kit".
My first kit is a clock. I have added the kit instructions and pictures of my work.
I may do more kits in the future.
